# sudo

This command allows you to run programs with the security privileges of another user (by default, as the superuser). It prompts you for your personal password and confirms your request to execute a command. This command makes it easier to practice the principle of least privilege (PoLP), which is a computer security concept that helps control system access and potential system exploits and compromises.

**Example**

```bash
sudo command
```

> Replace [command] with the command for which you want to use sudo.


**Usage**

```bash
sudo apt update
```

The above command will execute the apt update command with superuser privileges.
