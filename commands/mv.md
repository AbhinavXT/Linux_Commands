# mv

The primary use of this command is to move files, although it can also be used to rename files.

**Example**

```bash
mv <filename> <path/to/directory>
```

> Replace <filename> with the file you want to move and <path/to/directory> with the directory where you want the file to be moved.

```bash
mv <old-filename> <new-filename>
```

> Replace <old-filename> with the old name of the file you want to rename and <new-filename> with the the new name you want to give to your file.

**Usage**

```bash
mv file.txt </home/username/Documents>
```

The above command will move the example file `file.txt` to the `Documents` directory of user `username`


```bash
mv oldname-file.txt newname-file.txt
```

The above command will rename the example file `oldname-file.txt` as `newname-file.txt`
