## ls

Inside a folder you can list all the files that the folder
contains using the

```
ls
```

If you add a folder name or path, it will print that folder
contents:

```
ls /bin
```

`ls` accepts a lot of options like:

```
ls -a #Shows hidden files
```

```
ls -l # Shows file size
```

```
ls -R # Recursively lists all files
```
